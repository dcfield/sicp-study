; Part II Question
; Use your procedure to find the three smallest primes larger than 1000
; larger than 10,000
; larger than 100,000
; larger than 1,000,000. 
; Note the time needed to test each prime. 
; Since the testing algorithm has order of growth of Î˜(root(n)), 
; you should expect that testing for primes around 10,000 
; should take about root(10) times as long as testing for primes around 1000. 
; Do your timing data bear this out?

; Part II timings calculations
; root(10) ~ 3.16
; First, get timings of smallest primes larger than 1000.

(search-for-primes 1000 1100)
; 1009 *** 0.
; 1013 *** 0.
; 1019 *** 0.
; Too small - let's try some much bigger numbers.

(search-for-primes 100000000000 100000000100)
; 100000000003 *** .45999999999999996
; 100000000019 *** .4800000000000004
; 100000000057 *** .4599999999999991

; Before doing a calculation of a range bigger by a factor of 10, let's estimate the timings.
; Prime 1 should equal (.45 * 3.16) ~ 1.42s
; Prime 2 should equal (.48 * 3.16) ~ 1.52s
; Prime 3 should equal (.46 * 3.16) ~ 1.45s

; Let's test!
(search-for-primes 1000000000000 1000000000100)
; 1000000000039 *** 1.4600000000000009
; 1000000000061 *** 1.4700000000000006
; 1000000000063 *** 1.4699999999999989
; Not far off!
